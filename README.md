# Cybersecurity Hands-on Projects

## Project 1: [CyberKillChain-using-OWASP-JuiceShop](https://github.com/reyincyber/cybersecurity/tree/9a3b50674c70b47eb1d74a422f618e4a9008f26f/CyberKillChain-using-OWASP-Juiceshop)
### Assessing the Effectiveness of Defensive Strategies at Each Stage of the Cyber Kill Chain in Simulated Cyberattacks
This project simulates cyberattacks at each stage using **Kali Linux, Burp Suite, and OWASP ZAP**, targeting the **OWASP Juice Shop**, a deliberately vulnerable web application. The effectiveness of defensive strategies at each stage is evaluated. The **Cyber Kill Chain** framework, developed by **Lockheed Martin (2011)**, outlines the seven stages of a cyberattack. This model helps organizations understand attacker tactics and apply appropriate defensive measures.
